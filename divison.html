        he majority of the runs during their successful era have come from Warner and Williamson himself to an extent. The bowling load was largely shared by Rashid and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Warner and Rashid have left now, Bhuvneshwar hasn't been at his best in the last couple of years and that only means SRH need their new faces to step up. They have added the legendary Brian Lara and Dale Steyn to their coaching ranks to go with the likes of Muttiah Muralitharan and Tom Moody. There will definitely be no shortage of technical inputs to the playing group as they look to begin the new era with a bang.

        SRH begin their campaign only on March 29 against Rajasthan Royals in Pune - a venue they will return to only in May again to play two more games. After the opening game, they will be playing four out of their next five games at the DY Patil Stadium. They will also play three more at the Brabourne Stadium and four at the Wankhede. With 10 teams in action this time, SRH will play Royals, Mumbai Indians, Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals only once this season in the league stage.
