    Last season, Sunrisers Hyderabad were easily the most criticised outfit in the Indian Premier League. No one really saw the 'ostracisation' of David Warner coming and their own fan base had a go at them constantly towards the end of the campaign. The SRH-Warner split was pretty much evident at that stage as the franchise opted to not retain him ahead of the mega auction. But what came as a surprise later on was their failure to keep hold of Rashid Khan as well. The Afghanistan legspinner is easily one of the most sought-after players in the world in T20 cricket and the franchise's inability to retain him meant they had to enter a new era without their two lynchpins around whom their success in recent years was built.

On expected lines, the franchise handed over the reins to Kane Williamson on a full-time basis. Leading SRH isn't unfamiliar territory for Williamson. He did lead them to the final in 2018 when Warner was unavailable and in the Australian's absence, the New Zealander went on to score more than 700 runs in the season as well. SRH will be glad that they have one of the world's most likeable cricketers leading them after a chaotic season but can he replicate the success they have had over the years?

    he majority of the runs during their successful era have come from Warner and Williamson himself to an extent. The bowling load was largely shared by Rashid and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Warner and Rashid have left now, Bhuvneshwar hasn't been at his best in the last couple of years and that only means SRH need their new faces to step up. They have added the legendary Brian Lara and Dale Steyn to their coaching ranks to go with the likes of Muttiah Muralitharan and Tom Moody. There will definitely be no shortage of technical inputs to the playing group as they look to begin the new era with a bang.

League phase venue split

SRH begin their campaign only on March 29 against Rajasthan Royals in Pune - a venue they will return to only in May again to play two more games. After the opening game, they will be playing four out of their next five games at the DY Patil Stadium. They will also play three more at the Brabourne Stadium and four at the Wankhede. With 10 teams in action this time, SRH will play Royals, Mumbai Indians, Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals only once this season in the league stage.
